This repository contains Python code that combines sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques to predict stock prices. The code processes sentiment data and historical stock price data, trains a neural network model, and evaluates its performance on stock price prediction.
- A feedforward neural network model is defined and trained using Keras and TensorFlow.
- The model's predictive performance is assessed using metrics like mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared.
-  Results displayed by GUI made using python
