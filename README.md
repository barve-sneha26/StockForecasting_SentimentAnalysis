# Stock Forecasting and Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository showcases a project that combines sentiment analysis with machine learning techniques to predict stock prices. By integrating data from historical stock prices and social media (X, formerly known as Twitter) sentiment, this project aims to enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions, providing valuable insights for investors and financial analysts.

## Project Goals

- **Stock Price Forecasting**: Utilize historical stock data to forecast future prices using machine learning models.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze public sentiment from Twitter to gauge market sentiment and its potential impact on stock prices.
- **Model Integration**: Combine sentiment analysis with traditional stock forecasting models to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the predictive performance of the models using relevant statistical metrics.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Keras, TensorFlow
- **Data Collection**: Yahoo Finance API, Tweepy API
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **GUI Development**: Tkinter 

## Methodologies and Approach

### 1. Data Collection
   - **Historical Stock Data**: Collected from Yahoo Finance using Python’s `yfinance` library.
   - **Sentiment Data**: Gathered from Twitter using the Tweepy API, focusing on tweets related to specific stocks.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
   - **Stock Data Processing**: Cleaned and normalized the historical stock data to prepare it for model training.
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Processed tweet data to extract sentiment scores, which were then combined with stock data to create a comprehensive dataset.

### 3. Model Development
   - **Neural Network Architecture**: Defined a feedforward neural network model using Keras and TensorFlow, designed to learn from both historical stock prices and sentiment data.
   - **Model Training**: Trained the neural network on the combined dataset, using features such as historical stock prices and sentiment scores.

### 4. Performance Evaluation
   - **Metrics Used**: Evaluated the model’s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²) to ensure the accuracy and reliability of predictions.
   - **Results Visualization**: Implemented a GUI using Python to display the model’s predictions and performance metrics in an intuitive manner.

### 5. Deployment and Integration
   - **User Interface**: Developed a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python to allow users to input stock symbols and view predictions based on the trained model.

## Key Deliverables

- **Trained Neural Network Model**: A model capable of predicting stock prices by considering both historical data and sentiment analysis.
- **Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly interface for visualizing stock predictions and performance metrics.
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: A combined dataset of historical stock prices and sentiment scores, used to train the predictive model.

## Business Impact

This project provides a powerful tool for investors and financial analysts, enabling more informed decision-making by combining traditional stock forecasting with sentiment analysis. The integration of social media sentiment allows for a more nuanced understanding of market trends, potentially leading to better investment strategies and improved financial outcomes.

## Conclusion

By blending sentiment analysis with machine learning, this project demonstrates the potential of advanced data science techniques in financial forecasting. The ability to predict stock prices with greater accuracy through the integration of diverse data sources highlights the value of innovation in the financial industry.
